# Existing Log Viewer Solutions for Google Cloud

After research, here are some options for accessing Cloud Logs:

## Google Cloud Native Options

1. **Google Cloud Console Logs Explorer**
   - Built into Google Cloud Console
   - Web interface for querying logs
   - Advanced filtering capabilities

2. **Google Cloud Logging API**
   - Direct programmatic access to logs
   - RESTful API with client libraries for multiple languages

## Custom Implementation Recommendation

The simplest approach for your needs would be a lightweight custom service as detailed in the implementation guide. None of the existing open-source solutions are directly tailored for your specific use case of a simple HTTP endpoint for Cloud Run logs.

The custom implementation using Cloud Run with Node.js/Express or Python/Flask would be:
- Minimal deployment footprint
- Simple to implement and maintain
- Specifically tailored to your requirements
- Can be secured with basic authentication
- Lightweight enough for occasional use
